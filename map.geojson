      "description":"In this section of Firdawsi's Shahnama, Zal, the son of King Sam, the cavalier, has completed a final quest to receive King Manuchihr's acceptance to marry the love of his life, Rudabeh, the princess of Kabul. Zal has now arrived in Manuchihr's kingdom with a letter from his father written for Manuchihr. In this scene, Zal is seen approaching King Manuchihr's throne and awaiting his response to the letter. The two have a conversation about the journey, and Zal asserts that everything went very well. After reading the letter, Manuchihr soon begins to proclaim his gratitude to Zal by explaining to him that this letter has resolved a great grief of his and states that \"[he is] resolved to think of it no more\" (Firdawsi, 1420-40, 306). After their conversation, Zal joins the king and his men for a great feast; after the men eat, Manuchir and Zal begin to converse again. Manuchihr then receives Zal with salutation and praise and gathers the noblemen to read the stars and determine Zal's fate. After three days, they concluded Zal's fate; Manuchihr explained that Zal's life should change for the better. The stars revealed that Zal would obtain many successes and become a better, more powerful version of himself."},

      "description":"Zal's motivations on this journey are very important because this quest was not for the traditional recognition as a hero but rather it was for the reward of love. Unfortunately for Zal, Rudabeh's father, the chief of Kabul, did not agree to the marriage of his daughter and Zal. However, this did not stop their love from pursuing. Zal's love for Rudabeh was too strong to give up, so the young man was determined to achieve her hand in marriage. This determination leads Zal to a more traditional heroic perspective. As chaos begins because of Rudabeh and Zal's love, it is up to Zal to fix everything. Thus making him the hero of this story. The Shahnama is known to highlight the heroic adventures of multiple characters, such as Zal. Scholars Omidsalar and Afshinvafaie (2022) discuss a term called the \"Hero Pattern,\" which refers to the long, elaborate narrative associated with the stories of heroes (182). Because Zal is seen as a heroic figure his story is elaborate and takes up many verses of the Shahnama. However, one of the most important moments is Zal’s determination to be with his love. Omidsalar and Afshinvafaie (2022) explain that \"Zal's loyalty is semiotically confirmed in the course of the story of his love for Rudabeh\" (187). Loyalty is an important characteristic of a heroic figure; a factor which Zal has not lacked since the beginning of his journey with Rudabeh."},

      "description":"It is evident that women and love have a strong influence on the men in the Shahnama. Particularly in the story of Zal and Rudabeh. Zal’s motivation behind this entire story is love. He becomes a heroic figure because he is determined to marry Rudabeh. It is clear that without the presence of love for a woman, this particular quest would not exist in the Shahnama. Rudabeh’s beauty is enough to get Zal to risk everything to marry her. The power of a woman is often overlooked, but in reality, it should be recognized because it is a strong influence in most heroic stories. Firuza Abdullaeva (2012) argues that the story of Rudabeh and Zal “presents a whole gallery of weak male figures, especially Rudaba’s father” (53). Therefore, Rudabeh weakens not only Zal’s train of thought but also her father’s. This is important to note because even kings succumb to the power of love and women. Ultimately, Rudabeh is a powerful character. Firstly because her love enticed Zal to fight for the approval of their marriage. And secondly, her love for Zal terrified the King so much that he considered killing his own daughter to keep her away from this marriage. "},

      "description":"Although this scene is based on Zal's love for Rudabeh, there is also a strong presence of male authority. Zal may be the hero of this story, but he is definitely not the most powerful figure. In order to marry Rudabeh, Zal needs Manuchihr's blessing. This blessing is the central point of Zal's love story. Manuchihr is known as a Shah, and Rudabeh's father will only allow the marriage if he agrees. In order to achieve his blessing Zal also had to go over his head and obtain a letter from his father, King Sam, in hopes of pleasing Manuchihr. In this image, it is clear who has the power. For example, Manuchihr is perched up and seated on what appears to be a throne while the rest of the men are standing and looking at him. Zal is also depicted as acting respectfully towards Manuchihr, waiting patiently while his hands are crossed as he slightly bows towards the throne. Secondly, the colours and materials in Manuchihr's clothing seem to be richer than the clothing of the rest of the men. His robe is a rich ruby red, often associated with people of high authority, and he has a cape draped upon him, which no one else is wearing."},

      "description":"Manuchihr is evidently the person in charge but not all of the attention is pointed toward him. In the image with King Manuchihr, the noblemen seem curious about the conversation. Still, they are also excited to be in the presence of Zal. In Firdawsi’s Shahnama (1420-40) it states that \“The nobles went to welcome him. On reaching The court he had an audience\” (306). In the story he is also referred to as the \“well-beloved.\” The noblemen are depicted with their eyes pointing towards the conversation, but in the bottom right of the image, you can also see a conversation occurring between two men right behind Zal. It is possible that the men are conversing about Zal and his work on this journey. However, the noblemen are not the only ones who praise Zal. Manuchihr also praises Zal because Sam’s letter resolved many issues for him. While the praise should be going to the man in power (Manuchihr in this case), it is clear that Zal is the character that holds everyone’s attention in this moment. After all, his motivations and heroic actions are an appealing aspect of this story. Furthermore, his character is praised because of his successful journey. Zal was able to stop all the chaos that his love for Rudabeh started in the first place, and besides gaining the Shah’s blessing, he also helped Manuchihr, thus pleasing everyone in this kingdom."},

      "description":"Another important aspect of this image to focus on is the stars which determine Zal’s fate. Strangely, the stars are not depicted at this moment, but there is a large plant which seems to end right at the top of the window, showing that the men are at a very high point of this building, the optimal location for stargazing. Fortunately, at this point in the story, Zal has already received Manuchihr’s blessing and praise. After Manuchihr praises Zal for his skills, he directly gathers the noblemen, wise men and astrologers to read the stars. In this image, many vibrant colours are in the background, creating a sense of excitement, which is valuable to this scene because there is a lot of anticipation for this moment. For example, revealing the sky in the window is a bright orange curtain pulled back; the colour orange is known to represent enthusiasm and excitement. At this moment, everyone seems excited to know what the stars will reveal. Finally, after three days, they concluded what Zal’s fate would be. Manuchihr explains that Zal’s life should change for the better; apparently, the stars said that Zal will now obtain things such as prolonged life, more strength, and most important the ability to marry his beloved (Firdawsi, 1420-40, 307)."},

      "description":"The story of Zal’s adventure is not told in one single manuscript. There have been multiple versions of the Shahnama made; Firdawsi’s story is known as the Baysunghur version. Another version is the Tahmasp Shahnama which is known as the most greatly illustrated copy of Firdawsi’s Shahnama. The scholar Eleanor Sims (1992) focuses on the aspects of the Baysungur version; she states that the images in this version are \“remarkable pictures for many reasons, not the least of which is the quality of the drawing, which avoids all prettiness, and the physical size and emotive amplitude of their figures.\” (44). The Baysunghur Shahnama may have avoided beauty and extravagance, but the Tahmasp Shahnama certainly does not. The Tahmasp version of Manuchihr and Zal’s encounter is much more elaborate. Although it does not take up the entire page as the Baysunghur, the colours are more elaborate. The background is filled with a royal blue, thus illuminating the scene. This scene is also much busier than the Baysunghur, more people are depicted, and more action is present. By examining both versions a greater insight of the story can be achieved because elements from the story can be seen in more detail in the Tahmasp version. For example, the praise of Zal is more pronounced since there are more people present to welcome him. As well as Zal’s emotions are presented more strongly as he is seen depicted on his knees almost begging for Manuchihr’s approval as he hands over the letter. Overall, the aspects associated with Zal’s story seem to be more emphasized in the Tahmasp version. "},
