    "description":"In this section of Firdawsi's Shahnama, Zal, the son of King Sam, the cavalier, has completed a final quest to receive King Manuchihr's acceptance to marry the love of his life, Rudabeh, the princess of Kabu. Zal has now arrived in Manuchihr's kingdom with a letter from his father written for Manuchihr. In this scene, Zal is seen approaching King Manuchihr's throne and awaiting his response to the letter. The two have a conversation about the journey, and Zal asserts that everything went very well. After reading the letter, Manuchihr soon begins to proclaim his gratitude to Zal by explaining to him that this letter has resolved a great grief of his and states that \"[he is] resolved to think of it no more\" (Firdawsi, 1420-40, 306). After their conversation, Zal joins the Kings for a great feast; after the men eat, Manuchir and Zal begin to converse again. Manuchihr then receives Zal with salutation and praise and gathers the noblemen to read the stars and determine Zal's fate. After three days, they concluded Zal's fate; Manuchihr explained that Zal's life should change for the better. The stars revealed that Zal would obtain many successes and become a better, more powerful version of himself."},

    "description":"Zal's motivations on this journey are very important because this quest was for the reward of love. Although Zal may seem like an honourable man, Rudabeh's father, the chief of Kabul, did not agree to their marriage. However, Zal's love for Rudabeh was too strong to give up, so the young man was determined to achieve her hand in marriage. This determination leads Zal to a heroic perspective. As chaos begins because of Rudabeh and Zal's love, it is up to Zal to fix everything. Thus making him the hero of this story. The Shahnama is known to highlight the heroic adventures of multiple characters, such as Zal. Scholars Mahmoud Omidsalar and Mohammad Afshinvafaie also examine Zal's story, motivations, and role as a heroic figure. Omidsalar and Afshinvafaie (2022) discuss a term called the \"Hero Pattern,\" which refers to the long, elaborate narrative associated with the stories of heroes (182). The story of Zal is elaborate and takes up many verses of the Shahnama, but one of the most important moments is Zal fighting to be with his love. Omidsalar and Afshinvafaie (2022) explain that \"Zal's loyalty is semiotically confirmed in the course of the story of his love for Rudabeh\" (187). However, it seems as though Zal is not a hero all the time; he is seen as a \"transitional hero\" because he is only depicted as heroic when he is determined to achieve something and motivation builds."},

    "description":"It is evident that women and love have a strong influence on the men in the Shahnama. Particularly in the story of Zal and Rudabeh. Zal’s motivation behind this entire story is love. He becomes a heroic figure because he is determined to marry Rudabeh. It is clear that without the presence of love for a woman, this particular quest would not exist in the Shahnama. Rudabeh’s beauty is enough to get Zal to risk everything to marry her. The power of a woman is often overlooked, but in reality, it should be recognized because it is a strong influence in most heroic stories. Firuza Abdullaeva (2012) argues that the story of Rudabeh and Zal “presents a whole gallery of weak male figures, especially Rudaba’s father” (53). Therefore, Rudabeh weakens not only Zal’s train of thought but also her father’s. This is important to note because even Kings succumb to the power of love and women. Ultimately, Rudabeh is a powerful character. Firstly because her love enticed Zal to fight for the approval of their marriage. And secondly, her love for Zal terrified the King so much that he considered killing his own daughter to keep her away from this marriage. "},

    "description":"Although this scene is based on Zal's love for Rudabeh, there is also a strong presence of authority. Zal may be the hero of this story, but he is definitely not the most powerful figure. In order to marry Rudabeh, Zal needs Manuchihr's blessing. This blessing is the central point of Zal's love story. Manuchihr is known as a Shah, and Rudabeh's father will only allow the marriage if he agrees. In order to achieve his blessing Zal also had to go over his head and obtain a letter from his father, King Sam, in hopes of pleasing Manuchihr. In this image, it is clear who has the power. For example, Manuchihr is perched up and seated on what appears to be a throne while the rest of the men are standing and looking at him. Zal is also depicted as acting respectfully towards Manuchihr, waiting patiently while his hands are crossed as he slightly bows towards the throne. Secondly, the colours and materials in Manuchihr's clothing seem to be richer than the clothing of the rest of the men. His robe is a rich ruby red, often associated with people of high authority, and he has a cape draped upon him, which no one else is wearing."},

    "description":"Manuchihr is evidently the person in charge but not all of the praise is pointed toward him. In the image with King Manuchihr, the noblemen seem curious about the conversation. Still, they are also excited to be in the presence of Zal. The noblemen are depicted with their eyes pointing towards the conversation, but in the bottom right of the image, you can also see a conversation occurring between two men right behind Zal. It is possible that the men are conversing about Zal and his work on this journey. After all, in the story, he is referred to as the “well-beloved.” However, the noblemen are not the only ones who praise Zal. Manuchihr also praises Zal because Sam’s letter resolved many issues for him. While the praise should be going to the man in power (Manuchihr in this case), it is clear that Zal is the character that holds everyone’s attention in this moment. After all, his motivations and heroic actions are an appealing aspect of this story. Furthermore, his character is praised because of his successful journey. Zal was able to stop all the chaos that his love for Rudabeh started in the first place, and besides gaining the Shah’s blessing, he also helped Manuchihr, thus pleasing everyone in this kingdom."},
