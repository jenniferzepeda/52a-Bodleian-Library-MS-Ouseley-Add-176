    "description":"\"In this section of Firdawsi's Shahnama, Zal, the son of King Sam, the cavalier, has completed a final quest to receive King Manuchihr's acceptance to marry the love of his life, Rudabeh, the princess of Kabu. Zal has now arrived in Manuchihr's kingdom with a letter from his father written for Manuchihr. In this scene, Zal is seen approaching King Manuchihr's throne and awaiting his response to the letter. The two have a conversation about the journey, and Zal asserts that everything went very well. After reading the letter, Manuchihr soon begins to proclaim his gratitude to Zal by explaining to him that this letter has resolved a great grief of his and states that \"[he is] resolved to think of it no more\" (Firdawsi, 1420-40, 306). After their conversation, Zal joins the Kings for a great feast; after the men eat, Manuchir and Zal begin to converse again. Manuchihr then receives Zal with salutation and praise and gathers the noblemen to read the stars and determine Zal's fate. After three days, they concluded Zal's fate; Manuchihr explained that Zal's life should change for the better. The stars revealed that Zal would obtain many successes and become a better, more powerful version of himself.\"},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
